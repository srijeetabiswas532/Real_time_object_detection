**Day 1:** GOAL: Building an object detection app. Ideally want to detect common house-hold items using my own laptop camera. Want to understand principles of spatial learning and computer vision with this project.
* Using YOLOv5 for this project as the model: widely used object detection model. Can identify and classify multiple objects in a **single forward pass** - ideal for real-time detection tasks.
    * Unlike older methods that needed to scan an image multiple times, YOLO only looks at the image once & predicts bounding boxes/class probabilities simultaneously.
    * Special type of CNN built for real-time object detection. 

WHERE YOU LEFT OFF: You are learning about how YOLO works, and then you need to actually begin this project step-by-step. [already in chat window, need to read]
